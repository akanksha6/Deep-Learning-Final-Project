# Deep-Learning-Final-Project

Run Diffusion_MNIST_FnalProject.ipynb to get denoised data from MNIST dataset and see the visualizations related to the dataset.

Run Fmnist_Diffusion_vfinal.ipynb to get denoised data from FashionMNIST dataset and see the visualizations related to the dataset.

Run cifar10_difusion_vfinal.ipynb to get denoised data from CIFAR10 dataset and see the visualizations related to the dataset.

The output image from the above ipynb files is used in NLP_FinalProject.ipynb where we perform operations on image as per user's input. The newly transformed images is then saved fir the user to use.
